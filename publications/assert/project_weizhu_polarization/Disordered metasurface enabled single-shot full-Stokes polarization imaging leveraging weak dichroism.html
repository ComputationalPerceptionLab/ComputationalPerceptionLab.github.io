<p class="sectitle" align = "left">Abstract</p>
<p class="body" align = "justify">Polarization, one of the fundamental properties of light, is critical for certain
	imaging applications because it captures information from the scene that
	cannot directly be recorded by traditional intensity cameras. Currently,
	mainstream approaches for polarization imaging rely on strong dichroism of
	birefringent crystals or artificially fabricated structures that exhibit a high
	diattenuation typically exceeding 99%, which corresponds to a polarization
	extinction ratio (PER) >~100. This not only limits the transmission efficiency of
	light, but also makes them either offer narrow operational bandwidth or be
	non-responsive to the circular polarization. Here, we demonstrate a singleshot
	full-Stokes polarization camera incorporating a disordered metasurface
	array with weak dichroism. The diattenuation of the metasurface array is ~65%,
	which corresponds to a PER of ~2. Within the framework of compressed sensing,
	the proposed disordered metasurface array serves as an efficient sensing
	matrix. By incorporating a mask-aware reconstruction algorithm, the signal
	can be accurately recovered with a high probability. In our experiments, the
	proposed approach exhibits high-accuracy full-Stokes polarimetry and highresolution
	real-time polarization imaging. Our demonstration highlights the
	potential of combining meta-optics with reconstruction algorithms as a promising
	approach for advanced imaging applications.</p>

<p class="secsectitle" align = "left">Operational principle</p>
<p class="body" align = "justify"> The operational principle of the nanophotonic polarization camera
	consists of three steps: calibration, capture, and reconstruction. (a). Schematic of
	the calibration process. 1.denotes a narrowband spectral filter. 2.denotes an
	imaging lens. (b). The responsivity matrix $R$ of the whole meta-device is calibrated
	from the photoresponses to the three pairs of orthogonal SoPs of incident light.
	(c). Schematic of the capture process. Scattered optical waves at each position $(x, y)$
	of target scene represented an unknown SoP $S = [S0,S1,S2,S3]^T$, illuminates the
	imaging system. (d). A single-shot capture process generates the polarizationencoded
	image $I$. (e). Mathematical description of the relation between $S_v$, $I_v$, and $Œõ$.
	(f). SoP reconstruction by the convolutional neural network. (g). Reconstructed SoP and
	corresponding position on Poincar√© sphere.</p>

<p class="secsectitle" align = "left">Network architecture:</p>
<p class="body" align = "justify"> The framework of the reconstruction algorithm. The
	reconstruction process is divided into two steps, the polarization data generator and the full
	convolutional neural network. $Œ£‚àó$ represents the forward imaging process, i.e., the label
	(or the target full-Stokes polarization image) first point-wise multiplies the polarization
	transmission matrix $M$, then integrates over the polarization dimension. The interference
	$ùêº_{ùëõ1}$ corresponds to the noise in image system and the interference $ùêº_{ùëõ2}$ is used to simulate
	the calibration errors in transmission matrix $M$. Through adding these interferences during
	the training process, the trained neural network could be robust to noise interferences
	existed in the imaging process. </p>

	filter and retarder successively. By rotating the angle of the polarizer and retarder, arbitrary
	SoP can be generated. The inset shows the disordered metasurface array (shown in orange
	box). (b-c) In our experiment, we selected a $16\times16$ subarray located in the upper-left
